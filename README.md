# Project-Management
Is a Web Application made in Spring Boot for managing employees tasks/projects, in this project I used Spring 5, Spring Boot 2, PostgreSQL, JPA, Thymeleaf, AOP, Web MVC, REST,
and Integration Tests.

Features:
Add/Update/Delete Employee
Add/Update/Delete Project
Assign Employee(s) to a Project
Track Employee(s) Project(s)
Display Project Timeline chart
Display Project Statuses chart

Still under development, still need to add Spring AOP and Spring Security.
